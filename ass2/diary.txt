19/04/21    19:00   0:00    coding              read spec for the assignment, started subset 0

20/04/21    23:00   3:00    coding, debugging   continued on subset 0, coded handling of addresses

21/04/21    21:30   1:00    coding, debugging   coded interpretting of regexes, quit and print command

22/04/21    23:00   4:00    coding              coded and fixed any issues with regex handling, written
                                                substitute command, finished subset 0, started subset 1,
                                                written handling of $ address and started comma handling.

23/04/21    22:00   2:00    coding, debugging   written handling of commas for all commands, written s command
                                                delimiter handling.

24/04/21    1:30    21:40   coding, debugging   refactored code so all the commands have their own subfunctions,
                                                attempted implemntation of multiple commands.

24/04/21    22:30   0:30    coding, debugging   refactored code again so it only prints output line in one place,
                                                continued to implement handling for multiple commands.

25/04/21    1:30    3:20    coding, debugging   most autotests for multiple commands passed except
                                                test63_subset1_multiple_commands.

25/04/21    3:30    3:44    coding, debugging   added some error checking and usage messages.

25/04/21    11:50   15:20   coding, debugging   fixed some cases for multiple commands, added -f flag and
                                                file checking for commands.

25/04/21    22:30   4:10    coding, debugging,  finished all tests, added more comments to the code.
                            testing
